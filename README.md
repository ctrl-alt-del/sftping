# sftping

An Android **SFTP client** built with **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose**. Connect to a
remote host, browse its filesystem, and move files in either direction with
resumable, pausable, background transfers.

- **Single `:app` module**, package `com.example.sftping`
- **minSdk 28** · **targetSdk 36** · **compileSdk 37**
- **License:** Apache-2.0

## Features

- **Connect with host-key verification (TOFU).** On first connect the app shows
  the server's **SHA-256** fingerprint and asks you to trust it. Subsequent
  connections are checked against the stored fingerprint and surface a
  `Trusted` / `Unknown` / `Changed` result (MITM warning on change). Trusted keys
  are **persisted** (DataStore) so they survive restarts, and can be **revoked**
  from a trusted-hosts manager or re-verified directly from the change warning.
- **Remote file browser** with folder navigation and **multi-select**
  (tap to enter, long-press to select).
- **Upload & download via the Storage Access Framework** — pick a document to
  upload, choose a destination to save a download.
- **Resumable transfers.** Byte offsets are persisted in Room; interrupted
  transfers resume from where they stopped (JSch `RESUME` mode).
- **Background transfers.** Each transfer runs in a WorkManager `dataSync`
  foreground service with a live progress notification, surviving app
  backgrounding and screen-off.
- **Pause / resume / cancel** from the Transfers screen.
- **Encrypted credentials at rest.** Passwords are sealed with an
  **Android Keystore** AES-256-GCM key and stored as ciphertext in DataStore,
  separate from the (non-secret) connection profile.

Tooling is intentionally bleeding-edge. Dependencies are managed in the version
catalog at [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`](gradle/libs.versions.toml) — add or bump
versions there, not inline in `build.gradle.kts`.

## Architecture

Single-Activity app. `MainActivity` hosts a Material 3 `NavigationSuiteScaffold`
with three tabs whose visibility is state-driven (no NavHost):

```
Connect  ──connected──▶  Files  ──"Not connected"──▶  Connect
                          │
                          └─ enqueue ─▶  Transfers (always accessible)
```

Transfers flow through a layered, protocol-agnostic pipeline so new transports
(FTP/SCP) can be added without touching the orchestrator:

```
SftpTransferWorker  ──▶  DownloadUseCase / UploadUseCase  ──▶  TransferStrategy
   (Android lifecycle:        (business logic:                  (protocol:
    FGS + notification)        offsets, retries,                 SftpTransferStrategy
                               DAO persistence)                  → JschSftpClient)
                                       │
                                       ▼
              Room (sftping.db)  ──Flow──▶  TransferManager (StateFlow)  ──▶  UI
```

Dependency injection is wired with Hilt through three modules:

- **`SftpModule`** — binds `JschSftpClient → ISftpClient`, `SftpTransferStrategy → TransferStrategy`
- **`SecurityModule`** — binds `KnownHostsStore`, provides the `AndroidKeyStore`
- **`DatabaseModule`** — provides the Room `TransferDatabase` (`sftping.db`) and DAO

## Build & Run

Prerequisites: Android SDK with **platform 37** installed, and **JDK 11+**.

```bash
# Build a debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on a connected device/emulator
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew testDebug                  # JVM unit tests (fast)
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest  # instrumented tests (device/emulator)
./gradlew lint                       # Android lint
```

Pure logic lives in testable classes covered by JVM unit tests in
`app/src/test/` (11 suites: SFTP path building, fingerprints, transfer use cases,
strategy progress, view models, etc.). The single instrumented test in
`app/src/androidTest/` exercises the real Android Keystore crypto round-trip.

## Known Limitations & Roadmap

- **Private-key auth is not wired.** The connection UI exposes a key toggle, but
  `JschSftpClient` currently authenticates with password / keyboard-interactive
  only.
- **Release build is unminified** (R8 disabled) and the **`applicationId` is
  `com.example.sftping`** — both must change before a Play Store release
  (Google rejects `com.example.*`).

## Development Workflow

This project follows a spec-driven development (SDD) process. Before building a
feature, read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (conventions), [`specs/SDD.md`](specs/SDD.md)
(workflow), and [`MEMORY.md`](MEMORY.md) (accumulated gotchas). Per-feature specs,
plans, test plans, and takeaways live under [`specs/`](specs/), indexed in
[`specs/index.md`](specs/index.md).
